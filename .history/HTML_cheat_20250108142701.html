<!-- the doctype. It is required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to
act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic
error checking and other useful things. However these days, they don’t do much, and are basically just needed to make
sure your document behaves correctly. That’s all you need to know for now -->
